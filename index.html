            <h3>What is App Development???</h3>
            <p>Application Development is the process of creating software applications that run on a mobile device, and a typical mobile application utilizes a network connection to work with remote computing resources.</p>

            <p>As is probably obvious from the name, a mobile developer builds applications that run natively on mobile devices, including smartphones, tablets, and some types of smartwatches. Usually, these professionals will specialize in either iOS or Android development but not both. </p>

            <p>Cloud computing encompasses services, programs, and applications that run over the cloud. That means they can be accessed remotely from practically any location, provided the user has an internet connection and an appropriate login. They offer plenty of advantages, including scalability.</p>

            <p>Not to be confused with a database administrator, who typically works with daily database upkeep and troubleshooting and implements the system, a database developer is responsible for building the database, modifying and designing existing or new programs, and ensuring that they satisfy the requirements of the users. Sometimes, the roles of database administrator and developer do overlap â€” this depends on the needs of the client or employer.</p>

                A desktop application is a software program that can be run on a standalone computer to perform a specific task by an end-user. Some desktop applications such as word editor, photo editing app and media player allow you to perform different tasks while other such as gaming apps are developed purely for entertainment.

    <h4>Advantages of Native Apps:</h4>
    <p>
        <pre>
            1) Native Apps have the best performance
            2) Native Apps are more secure
            3) Native Apps are more Interactive and Intuitive
            4) Native Apps allow developers to access The Full Feature of Set of devices
            5) Native App Development tend to have fewer bugs during development

        <h4>Disadvantages of Native Apps: </h4>
        <pre>
            1) Native Apps are very expensive to develop 
            2) Developing Native Apps consume more time
            3) The development of apps are difficult to process
            4) Developers come up with different ideas for updates but implementing them on <br> different operating system become very <br> difficult
            5) Download requirement is different on different on different operating systems

        <h1>Hybrid Apps</h1>
        <p>
            Applications developed for cross platform compatibiliy are called hybrid apps. They can be used on any platform irrespective of the operating system. 
            A hybrid app is a way to build an app in one coding language that functions across multiple platforms (for example, an app that can be deployed to both iPhone and Android devices).
        </p>
        <img src="download (3).jpeg" alt="Hybrid applications">
        <h3>Advantages of Hybrid Apps</h3>
        <pre>
            1) A benefit of maintaining a single base for multiple operating systems is that it is able <br> to lower the costs of developing them.
            2) HTML is known to use simple HTML language which is easy to maintain, <br> unlike in native apps where there is no concept of versioning.
            3) Hybrid apps are easily made scalable to various platforms. <br> Developers can target multiple O/S without much effort.
            4) Significant amount of time is saved by writing a code only once. <br> Thus, the development time is much faster compared to a native app. Apps that usually take months to develop is made ready within several weeks if followed a native approach. 
            5) Constant updates are released by the developers to fix bugs and other errors in a hybrid application. <br> These updates do not need to get approval from the app store.
        </pre>
        <br> <br>
        <h3>Disadvantages of Hybrid Apps</h3>
        <pre>
            1) They are not as fast as native apps
            2) They have limited functionalities
            3) Hybrid apps are known to face many quality issues. <br> On the contrary to a native app, it cannot deliver pictures of high graphics.
            4) No matter how skilled the developer is in coding, there is always a tendency of having errors and bugs.
            5) Whatever the content loaded in a hybrid app can be glitchy. <br>  They cannot function smoother as similar to a native app. However, there are some ways that can be used to avoid glitches.
